## Core functions

As an open source alternative to Salesforce, Huayan Cube Core solves the following problems:

 ### Low-code front-end

Controls, asset packages (a set of controls), pages, page visual design tools, and data interaction between pages and servers. Reference: [Saleforce Lightning](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc)

### Server-side low code

Models, permissions, rules, processes, reports, connections to third-party systems, and the above-related visual design tools. Reference: [Salesforce Object](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_concepts.htm)

### Metadata

How visualization tools save metadata, how rendering engines call metadata, and how metadata is synchronized to the code repository. Reference: [Salesforce Metadata API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_intro.htm)

### Integrate high code

How to integrate high-code in the front-end and back-end to implement complex business logic in a low-code system. Reference: [Salesforce Functions](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/functions/guide/dev-guide-intro.html)

### Software package

The metadata generated by the front-end and back-end low-code visual design tools, and how the customized code is combined into a software package. As well as software package version management, release, installation, personalization, version upgrade, multi-package development, and integration with existing DevOps solutions. Reference: [Salesforce Package](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_unlocked_pkg_whats_a_package.htm)


## Based on metadata

Metadata is the core of Huayan Rubik's Cube technical architecture. Huayan Rubik's Cube uses metadata to define objects, fields, configurations, codes, logic and page layouts, and automatically generates the system's data structure as well as the user interface and automation logic of the Steedos application based on these metadata.
